# Digital Logic Design

This repository contains all computer assignments developed for the course  
**Digital Logic Design (ECE 367) – Digital System I**,   
offered by the    
**Electrical and Computer Engineering Department,    
University of Tehran – Fall 1403**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Zainalabedin Navabi**.

## Overview

These projects cover foundational and advanced topics in digital logic design, including switch-level gate structures, combinational logic, sequential circuits, state machines, and RTL accelerator design. They involve Verilog/SystemVerilog implementation, simulation, synthesis, and FPGA testing.
